Simple Blog App

It's a complete working Node Js project. In which I have used Express Js and MongoDB.

# Disclaimer: This is only for learning purpose.

**Created using Node Js, Express, MongoDB**

#Dependencies:

- `Express`
- `Mongoose`
- `Body-Parser`
- `Multer`

For Request and Response I have used **Postman**. Import file `post.postman_collection.json` in Postman.

Note:

- In `config.env` file you have to use your own mongoose link which you can get from http://cloud.mongodb.com/.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start
```
